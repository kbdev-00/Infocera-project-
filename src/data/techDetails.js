                question: "What is Redis?",
                answer: "Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, message broker, and queue. It supports various data structures and provides exceptional performance with sub-millisecond latency, making it perfect for caching, session storage, and real-time applications."
            },
            {
                question: "How can Redis improve application performance?",
                answer: "Redis dramatically improves performance by caching frequently accessed data in memory, reducing database load and response times from milliseconds to microseconds. Use cases include database query caching, session storage, API response caching, leaderboards, and rate limiting - all with blazing-fast access."
            },
            {
                question: "Is Redis persistent?",
                answer: "Yes, Redis offers persistence options: RDB (point-in-time snapshots) and AOF (append-only file logging every operation). You can configure persistence based on durability needs. For pure caching, persistence may be optional. For session storage or queues, persistence ensures data survives restarts."
            },
            {
                question: "Can Redis replace my database?",
                answer: "Redis complements rather than replaces traditional databases. It excels at caching, session management, real-time analytics, and pub/sub messaging. While it can persist data, it's optimized for in-memory speed. Best practice: use Redis with your primary database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for optimal architecture."

                answer: "Apache Tomcat is an open-source implementation of Java Servlet, JSP, and WebSocket technologies. It's a lightweight application server for running Java web applications. Unlike full Java EE servers, Tomcat focuses on servlet/JSP containers, making it faster and simpler for standard web applications."
            },
            {
                question: "Is Tomcat a web server or application server?",
                answer: "Tomcat is primarily a servlet container/application server for Java applications, not a full-featured web server like Apache HTTP Server. However, it can serve static content. For production, it's often paired with Apache or Nginx as reverse proxy for better performance and security."
            },
            {
                question: "What's the difference between Tomcat and other Java servers?",
                answer: "Tomcat implements Servlet/JSP specs, making it lightweight and fast for web applications. Full Java EE servers (WildFly, WebLogic, WebSphere) support additional specs (EJB, JMS, etc.) but are heavier. Choose Tomcat for web apps, full servers for enterprise applications needing complete Java EE features."

                answer: "Deploy Java web applications to Tomcat by placing WAR files in the webapps directory or using the Manager App web interface. Tomcat automatically deploys and starts applications. We configure automated deployment pipelines, context configurations, and clustering for production environments."

It uses an asynchronous, event-driven architecture to handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently. Nginx powers many of the world's busiest websites including Netflix, Dropbox, and WordPress.com."

It's faster for static files and better at load balancing. Apache offers more flexibility with .htaccess and mod_rewrite. Often both are used together - Nginx as reverse proxy, Apache for dynamic content."

Its versatility and performance make it essential for modern web infrastructure."

                answer: "Jest is a comprehensive JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook. It's designed for testing JavaScript applications, especially React, with features like zero configuration, snapshot testing, mocking, code coverage, and parallel test execution. Jest provides a complete testing solution with assertion library and test runner built-in."
            },
            {
                question: "Why use Jest over other testing frameworks?",
                answer: "Jest offers zero configuration for most projects, excellent React integration, built-in code coverage, snapshot testing, powerful mocking capabilities, fast parallel execution, and great developer experience. While Mocha/Chai require setup, Jest works out of the box. It's the de facto standard for React testing."

                question: "What is snapshot testing?",
                answer: "Snapshot testing captures the output of a component or function and saves it as a reference. In subsequent tests, Jest compares new output to the saved snapshot. If they differ, the test fails, alerting you to unexpected changes. It's excellent for UI components, catching regressions automatically."

Jest is framework-agnostic and provides comprehensive testing capabilities for all JavaScript applications, not just React."
